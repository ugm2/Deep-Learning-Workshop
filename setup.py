    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    name='dl_workshop',  # Required

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
    #
    version='0.0.1',  # Required

    # This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
    # corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
    description='Implementation of some of the main Deep Learning Algorithms with some examples',
    # Required

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(),  # Required

    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.

    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]
